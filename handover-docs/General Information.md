## How to connect to the Mongo database running on the server
If you need to connect locally to the database running on the production server, it is really easy. All you have to do is to download the Robomongo software. Here is a link: `https://robomongo.org/`.

Once you have downloaded the software and opened it you can create a connection. To do that you need an ip address and a port number. Enter the following `46.101.190.192:32768`

- `46.101.190.192` : the specific ip address on which out database is hosted
- `32768` : the specific port that mongo db i slistening on

Now you should be able to look at what is inside the database.
