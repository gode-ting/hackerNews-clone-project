## Items

Stories and polls. They're identified by their ids, which are unique integers. All items have some of the following properties:

| Field | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | The item's unique id. | String |
| parent | The comment's parent id. The parent could be  another comment or a story | String |
| username | The username of the item's author | String |
| type | The type of item. i.e. "story, comment, poll" | String |
| title | The title of the story, poll or job | String |
| text | The comment, story or poll | String |
| url | The URL of the story | String |
| karma |
| upvotedBy |
| downvotedBy |
| created_at |
</br>  

An example of a story:

```javascript

{
    "id": "59f87c655b1dc209f10c0048",
    "username": "Frank",
    "post_type": "story",
    "post_title": "Student Guide 102",
    "post_text": "Good  stuff",
    "post_url": "http://www.google.com",
    "post_parent": ""
}

```

An example of a comment:

```javascript

{
    "id": "57f87c655b1dc209f10c6527",
    "username": "BunnyTheRabbit",
    "post_type": "comment",
    "post_title": "The Worlds Greatest Title",
    "post_text": "Awesome commnt text",
    "post_url": "http://www.yahoo.com",
    "post_parent": "59f87c655b1dc209f10c0048"
}

```  

Obs: Regarding other required post fields.

In the assignment we are specifically told that our backend is supposed to handle fields like `hanesst_id`, `post_parent`, `username` and `password`. Here is an exmaple provided by the assigment:

```sh

{
	"post_title": "Y Combinator", 
 	"post_text": "", 
 	"hanesst_id": 1, 
 	"post_type": "story", 
 	"post_parent": -1, 
 	"username": "pg", 
 	"pwd_hash": "Y89KIJ3frM", 
	 "post_url": "http://ycombinator.com"
}

```

Our API is able to digest this kind of request, and the fields will be stored in the Post object. But we do not really use `hanesst_id`, `post_parent`, `username` and `password` to anything other than making sure that our api meets the assignment requirements.

Th Post object creates it's own unique id called `id` (not the hanesst id) and another field called `parent` (not post_parent). These values are of type String. So whenever our frontend makes request to the backend we will never use `hanesst_id`, `post_parent`. We will use our own fields/attributes.  Â
